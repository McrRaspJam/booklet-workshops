	\section{Introduction}
		We usually have a full set of notes for our main workshop. This time, we'll be skimming over a lot of programs that have been better covered by other people.
		
		So following on from the NOOBS setup guide in section \ref{sec:NOOBS}, section \ref{sec:Resources} will be a compilation of various sources of Raspberry Pi tutorials and guides.
		
		These booklets were created using {\fontfamily{rfdefault}\selectfont \LaTeX}, an advanced typesetting system for several sorts of books, reports and letters.
