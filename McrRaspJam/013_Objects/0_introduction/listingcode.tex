	When you need to make changes to your code, they'll be presented in boxes like the following:

	\lstinputlisting[style=Java, firstline=1, firstnumber=1, lastline=4]{McrRaspJam/013_Objects/0_introduction/HelloWorld.java}
	
	You might not need to copy everything, so check the line numbers to make sure you're not copying something twice.
