\section{Java quick start}

	In your preferred editor, create a new file and copy the following code.
	
	\lstinputlisting[style=Java]{McrRaspJam/013_Objects/1_java/HelloWorld.java}
	
	Save this file as \textbf{HelloWorld.java}, then open a terminal to the same folder, and type the following commands:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[style=Terminal]
$ javac HelloWorld.java
$ java HelloWorld
Hello, World!
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	Now, compare that to the equivalent Python program:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[style=Python]
	print("Hello, World")
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	Coming from most over languages, Java may seem quite complicated. You'll find out that in Java, we have to use a lot of terms that would be optional or excluded in other languages. Java is a language where seemingly nothing is implied.
	
	Luckily, for most basic programs, those lines are all the same, so it's more a matter of memorising something than anything truly complicated.
