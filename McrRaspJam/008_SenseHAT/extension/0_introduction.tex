	%Workshop Description
	In the Sense HAT workshop, you learned all of the hardware features of the Sense HAT, and used the Python APi to write programs to read and control them.
	
	The following festive extension will guide you through the creation of a program that draws a snowstorm on the Sense HAT's LED matrix, which can then be controlled using the temperature sensor.
	
	This exercise is designed so you complete it at your own pace, but do ask if you get stuck at any point!
