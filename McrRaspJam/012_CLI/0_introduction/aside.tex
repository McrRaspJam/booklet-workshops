Occasionally, something will be explained in greater detail in asides, like the one below. You can read these as you wish, but they're not required to complete the workshop.
	
\begin{aside}[The Shell]
	The command line interface isn't really a built-in part of the Linux operating system. It's a type of program called a `shell', that runs on top of the operating system.
	
	Raspbian uses `bash' (\textbf{B}ourne-\textbf{A}gain \textbf{SH}ell), which is the most typical shell in Linux distributions, but you could choose to install an alternative shell.
