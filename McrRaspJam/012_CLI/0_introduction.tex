	%Workshop Description
	This workshop takes a look at the basics of the Linux Command Line Interface (\textbf{CLI}), primarily to be able to configure and maintain our Pi's software.
	
	On a Linux computer the desktop only scratches the surface of the programs and functionality available. We'll only be able to take a look at the very basics today, but for each new trick you learn in the CLI, you'll find a new way to save a little time when using your computer.

	%Difficulty
	This is an intermediate Workshop. Once you're familiar with using your Pi on the desktop, you should be ready to attempt this workshop.
