Occasionally, a concept will be explained in greater detail in \textit{asides}, like the one below. You can read these as you wish, but they're not required to complete the workshop.
	
\begin{aside}[Resistors]
	Resistors are commonly used to limit the amount of current flowing through part of an electrical circuit.
	
	For example we use resistors with LEDs, as otherwise they could draw so much power that they destroy themselves.
	
	Buttons have almost no internal resistance, so we use high value ($\sim 10  k\Omega$) resistors to prevent current flowing straight from the power supply to ground; if we didn't, the entire CPU could be short circuited, and the Pi would lose power!
