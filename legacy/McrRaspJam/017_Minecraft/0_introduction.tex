\section{Introduction}

	Included in Raspbian, the operating system we run on our Raspberry Pi's is a copy of the `Pi Edition' of \textit{Minecraft}. 
	
	This version of Minecraft is based on the creative mode from \textit{Minecraft: Pocket Edition}, but in this version we can use the Python programming language to modify the game world.
	
	%Difficulty
	This is an introductory workshop. It's useful to have programmed in Python before,  but all of the programming concepts will be covered from scratch.
