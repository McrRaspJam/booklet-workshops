\section{Introduction}
	
	Object-oriented programming is a different way to represent complex concepts than the traditional programming methods.
	Today we'll take a look at what objects are using the Java programming language.	
	Then, we'll use objects to create characters for a computerised tabletop role-playing game.

	%Difficulty
	This is an intermediate workshop, that builds upon a familiar knowledge of a text-based programming language like Python.
